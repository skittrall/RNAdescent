RNAdescent

A package to find highly conserved regions in alignments of RNA sequences, by casting the problem as one of finding unusually large descents in a random walk.

INSTALLATION
The code is supplied as a Mathematica notebook, and just the notebook can be downloaded and run in interactive mode on a machine with a Mathematica installation.  The code was originally written in Mathematica 12.  The notebook contains examples that can be uncommented and run, or information on codon usage from an alignment can be imported.
